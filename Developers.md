- The public GIT is available here: [https://gitlab.polimi.it/Pub/mbdyn](https://gitlab.polimi.it/Pub/mbdyn). 
	- Instructions for contributors are available here:
          [https://gitlab.polimi.it/Pub/mbdyn/wikis/Development/Developers-Guidelines](https://gitlab.polimi.it/Pub/mbdyn/wikis/Development/Developers-Guidelines). 
	- Read this [FAQ]({{ "FAQ#HOW_DO_I_SUBMIT_A_PATCH_TO_MBDYN" | relative_url}})
          for guidelines to software/documentation contributions. 
	- It is recognized that MBDyn's documentation lags a bit behind source code releases. 
	  As such, this link hosts the input manual and other docs that may refer to yet unreleased code, 
	  but that are likely to be more accurate and useful of those accompanying any of the official releases, 
	  and get updated more often; the intention is to refresh them quite often.
