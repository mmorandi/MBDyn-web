# Mailing lists

## Mailing lists will likely be disconotinued in a nrea future.

_NOTE: for reasons outside our direct control, 
the SSL certificate of the lists server does not match the server's name.  
This (legitimately) causes concern in some browsers. 
Please be patient and consider accepting to make 
an exception until the problem is solved_.
 
* [Subscribe](https://mail.mbdyn.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mbdyn-announce) 
  to **announce**; browse the [archives](http://mail.mbdyn.org/pipermail/mbdyn-announce/).
  Subscribe to this list to receive announcements related to **MBDyn**, 
  e.g. new releases, events and other related issues. 
  Very low traffic is expected.
  _Only the project manager can post to this list_. 
* [Subscribe](https://mail.mbdyn.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mbdyn-users) 
  to users; browse the [archives](http://mail.mbdyn.org/pipermail/mbdyn-users/).
  Subscribe to this list to participate in discussions 
  about the use of **MBDyn**. 
  Bug tracking is dealt with through the GIT repository 
  [issue mechanism](https://public.gitlab.polimi.it/DAER/mbdyn/-/issues); 
  however, this list can host discussion about what you think might be a bug, or to propose enhancements. 
  _Only subscribers can post to this list. The list is moderated_.

_Please note that posting to the mailing list implies that
**some of your personal data** (specifically, but not limited to,
your **email address** and anything that appears in your email)
**will become publicly visible**; it will appear in the mailing list archives,
which might be mirrored or backed up by third parties and thus get
out of the project's control, without the possibility
to be later removed (impossibility, by the project, to grant you
any right to oblivion).  
**By posting to our mailing list you positively accept this fact**._

Contact instructions:
* send _public inquiries_ to [mbdyn-users@mbdyn.org](mailto://mbdyn-users@mbdyn.org) (only subscribers can post to this list). Public discussion is open and free, since it may be beneficial to all users; it implies that all exchanged data and information is public;
* send _private inquiries_ to
  [mbdyn@polimi.it](mailto://mbdyn@polimi.it).
  Note that private discussion could end up to the point where
  it configures as consulting. In the latter case,
  an economical agreement might be required to continue support,
  since the software is free and open, but its developers'
  time is not (see our
  [consulting services]({{ "Documentation/Consulting.html" | relative_url }})
  for details).
